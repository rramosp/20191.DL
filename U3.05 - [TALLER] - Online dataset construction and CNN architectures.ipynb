    "    - images 64x64 or 128x128 resolution.\n",
    "    - increase the number of images.\n",
    "    - increase layers (convolutional and/or dense).\n",

    "**IN YOUR EXPERIMENT THERE MUST BE AN EVIDENCE OF ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT IN TEST DATA AS YOU INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF YOUR CNN ARCHITECTURE**. For this, you might need to select an appropriate Google images query pair so that the visual classification task beholds the appropriate complexity.\n"
